Sentiment analysis on twitter data using natural language processing and machine learning
# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. By classifying tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, this analysis can help monitor public opinion, brand perception, and trending topics in real time.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the raw and processed Twitter data.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, feature engineering, and model training.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for fetching tweets using the Twitter API, cleaning text data, and making sentiment predictions.
- **reports/**: Contains generated reports and visualizations for presenting results.
- **config/**: Stores API credentials and configuration settings (not shared publicly).

## Key Concepts

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying the sentiment of text data using NLP.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw tweet text for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) to predict sentiment.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git

 pip install -r requirements.txt

#### 4. **Add `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt`**

- **`.gitignore`**: Use a Python template and add files for Twitter credentials and datasets.
    ```plaintext
    __pycache__/
    .ipynb_checkpoints/
    venv/
    config/
    *.csv
    ```

- **`requirements.txt`**: List the necessary packages for NLP and data handling. Example:
    ```plaintext
    tweepy
    numpy
    pandas
    nltk
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    wordcloud
    ```

#### 5. **Key Project Files**
   - **Scripts** for data collection (`fetch_tweets.py`), text preprocessing (`clean_text.py`), and training/prediction (`train_model.py`).
   - **Jupyter Notebook**: Document the analysis, data visualization, and sentiment model training steps.
